        <p>I am a university student. It scares me to think what I did and how I wasted my time in the first two years of university, so I vowed to see myself as a web developer in my last two years of university.I hoped that I could fulfill this promise in the name of God.</p>

            <h2>Become a Web developer</h2>
            <p>It was in my third year of university that I got attracted to web development. Earlier a senior brother had told me about this during my first year but I did not try it as I was not aware of it. When I came to the third year, I remembered what my brother had said, if I had started 2 years earlier, I would have progressed a lot.</p>

            <p>A full-stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
               In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
                      Program a browser (e.g. using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue) 
                      Program a server (e.g. using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node) 
                      Program a database (e.g. using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)</p>

            <p>First things first, web development is basically about linking things together. If you get how to link pages to each , try to understand things like how HTML pages are linked to the code in JavaScript or Python or PHP.</p>
